# portfolio.github.io

This is my portfolio website. This is my first website as well. I have acquired some knowledge on HTML, CSS and JavaScript surfing the internet and it is the outcome of that only. If you have any suggestion regarding its improvement, I will be happy to hear that. Thanks for your time.

## Important Features

   This is built using `openrouter API` with `openai/gpt-3.5-turbo` model and personalised prompt is added so that it can answer questions on behalf of me.
