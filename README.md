# portfolio.github.io

This is my portfolio website. This is my first website as well. I have acquired some knowledge on HTML, CSS and JavaScript surfing the internet and it is the outcome of that only. If you have any suggestion regarding its improvement, I will be happy to hear that. Thanks for your time.

## Important Features

### 1. AI Chat Window

   This is built using `openrouter API` with `openai/gpt-3.5-turbo` model and personalised prompt is added so that it can answer questions on behalf of me.
   
   Update 1: Added `Gemini API`

### 2. Email Contact Form

   This is built using `SmtpJS` and `ElasticEmail`. Once user will fill the details and submit, a notification will confirm that the email is sent successfully and the message will reach to my mail.
